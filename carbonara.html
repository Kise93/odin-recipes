        <h2>Odin's Carbonara</h2>
        <p> Of all the theories of how carbonara sauce came to be—and there are a lot—the most probable is that it's just an old Roman dish using the <br>
            kinds of ingredients that have been kicking around the Italian countryside for centuries. Add to that plenty of freshly cracked black pepper, <br>
            a spice so deeply woven into Roman history that it was twice extracted as ransom by invaders, and you have the building blocks of the famed sauce.<br>
        </p>

        <p> But even if you subscribe to one of the other, more spurious origin stories, you have to admit it's a rare and remarkable recipe that includes<br>
             ingredients—eggs, cured pork, and cow's- and sheep's-milk cheeses—from all four of the major farm animals, as defined by the Major Farm Animal<br> 
             Index. (The 1973 version, not the one from '94, which anyone in their right mind would agree was a hot mess—alpacas at number five? Gimme a break.)<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>  
            While it's fundamentally a simple dish, the challenge of carbonara is cooking the sauce just enough to form a thick, silky coating on the pasta without <br>
            accidentally scrambling the eggs. I'll get to how to do that in just a second, but first I want to go over a few smaller decisions you'll have to make<br>
            before starting—namely, choosing your cut of pork, deciding whether to use whole eggs versus just yolks, and picking your cheeses.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>


            <li>Kosher salt (see note)</li>

            <li>1 pound (450g) dried spaghetti (see note)</li>

            <li>1/2 cup diced guanciale, pancetta, or bacon (about 3 ounces; 85g) (see note)</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>

            <li>2 whole large eggs plus 6 yolks</li>

            <li>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano (about 1 ounce; 25g), plus more for serving</li>

            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1 ounce; 25g), plus more for serving</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (ground medium-coarse), plus more for serving</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring, until al dente.</li>
                
            <li>Meanwhile, combine guanciale (or pancetta or bacon) with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a large skillet and cook, stirring frequently, over medium<br> 
                heat, until fat has rendered and guanciale is crisp, about 7 minutes.</li>

                
            <li>In a large, metal heatproof mixing bowl, whisk together whole eggs and yolks, Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and black pepper.</li>
                
            <li>Using tongs and/or a strainer, transfer pasta to skillet with crisped guanciale and its fat; be sure not to drain boiling pasta water. 
                Add remaining 1<br> tablespoon (15ml) olive oil to pasta and stir to combine; let cool slightly.<br> 
                Scrape pasta, pork, and all the fat into the egg mixture. <br>
                Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta-cooking water</li>

            <li>Set mixing bowl over pot of boiling pasta water (make sure bottom of bowl does not touch the water) and cook, stirring quickly with tongs, until<br> 
                sauce thickens to a creamy, silky consistency and leaves trails as you stir.<br> Remove from heat, season with salt if needed, and divide into bowls. Serve right away, topping with more grated cheese and freshly ground pepper <br>
                as desired. </li>
        </ol>
