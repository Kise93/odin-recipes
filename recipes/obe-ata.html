        <h1> ODIN'S OBE ATA RECIPE</h1>
        <img src="../images/obe-ata.webp">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nigerian obe ata is so many things that it can be hard to define. At its heart, it's a sauce<br> that can be used as a base for soups, stews, and braises that feature all sorts of meats,<br> vegetables, and even eggs. But it can also be cooked down until it grows thick and spreadable,<br> at which point it can be used as a condiment or a dip.</p>

        <p>This recipe, adapted from two different recipes from chefs Simileoluwa Adebajo and Esther<br> Ikuru, presents a baseline method for making the basic sauce, which can then be served with<br> various meats like a stew or cooked down into a condiment for dipping.</p>
        
        <p>Its main ingredients are red bells peppers along with hot fresh chili peppers like habaneros (or<br> Scotch bonnets), tomato, onion, garlic, and more. Beyond that, other decisions for flavoring the<br> sauce are up to you. You can use more or less red palm oil to stain it a deeper maroon color and<br> give it an earthier, sweeter flavor; you can add flavorings like Nigerian curry powder, fresh<br> ginger, and ground Cameroon chilies, which are both spicy and smoky; you can even choose<br> whether to make it a totally smooth purée or leave it chunkier for some texture.</p>
        
        <p>If you serve it as a stew, you have just as much flexibility with what you put in the stew and how<br> much you use of it. This recipe makes a large quantity of sauce, so you can divide it up and use<br> it in different ways. Try briefly simmering cooked chicken in it (as the recipe below suggests), or<br> try turkey, beef, lamb, or goat—cooked tripe is a popular option, too!. Hardboiled eggs can be<br> shelled and gently simmered in the sauce as well. Lots of vegetables, like sweet potatoes and<br> greens, can be cooked in the sauce for a vegetarian option.</p>
        
        <p>As a dip, it's great with plantain chips or with fufu (a starchy dish made from pounded and<br> boiled cassava root and green plantains).</p>
        
        <p>The best thing is to make a big batch and get creative: obe ata offers a world of serving possibilities. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                 <ul>


                    <li>8 red bell peppers (about 4 1/2 pounds; 2kg), stemmed, cored, and cut into roughly 1/2-inch dice</li>

                    <li>1 quart (1L) homemade chicken stock or store-bought, low-sodium broth, or vegetable stock</li>

                    <li>9 tablespoons (135ml) canola or other neutral oil</li>

                    <li>1/2 teaspoon Nigerian curry powder, such as Lion's Brand, or more to taste (optional, see note)</li>

                    <li>Ground Cameroon pepper, to taste (see note)</li>

                    <li>4 pounds (1.8kg) cooked bone-in chicken (optional)</li>

                    <li>Torn fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) and set oven racks in the top- and bottom-third positions.<br> 
                        Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                        
                    <li>In a large bowl, toss red bell pepper with 2 tablespoons (30ml) palm oil. Season with salt.<br> 
                        Transfer in an even layer to one of the rimmed baking sheets. In the same large bowl, toss the garlic, <br>
                        tomato, Fresno chili, habanero, onion, and ginger with 4 tablespoons (60ml) palm oil. Season with salt. <br>
                        Transfer in an even layer to the other rimmed baking sheet.</li>
                        
                    <li>Roast the vegetables, stirring and rotating baking sheets once or twice during cooking, until all are tender, <br>
                        some of their juices have cooked off, and they are charred in spots, about 45 minutes for the red bell peppers <br>
                        and 30 minutes for the tomatoes, chilies, and onions.</li>
                        
                    <li>Scrape all of the roasted vegetables into a blender jar and blend until either a chunky or smooth purée forms (the<br> 
                        consistency of your obe ata is up to you; we like a smoother sauce for when it is used for stews and a chunkier one <br>
                        when it is used as a dip or condiment).</li>
                        
                    <li>Transfer vegetable purée to a Dutch oven. Stir in chicken stock, remaining 3 tablespoons (45ml) palm oil, canola oil, <br>
                        curry powder, and Cameroon pepper. Bring to a simmer. Season lightly with salt, then simmer until sauce is reduced to a <br>
                        good stew-like thickness that can coat pieces of meat well, about 1 hour. If desired, season with additional curry powder and/or <br>
                        Cameroon pepper to meet your desired flavor and spice level.</li>
                        
                    <li>If serving with chicken, add cooked chicken to the Dutch oven and simmer until chicken is warmed through, about 15 minutes. <br>
                        Serve with warm rice and garnish with torn basil leaves, if desired.</li>
                        
                    <li>Alternatively, you can continue to cook down the sauce until it thickens to a dip-like consistency, about 3 hours; <br>
                        the oils will break from the sauce in this time and fry the vegetable purée, deepening its flavor further. </li>
                </ol>
