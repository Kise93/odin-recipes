        <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Who doesn't like the old fashioned? Whoever said "me," click away and get out. 
                    <p>The Old Fashioned is one of the most venerable of cocktails, predating not only the 
                    motorcar but the presidency of Abe Lincoln. All it takes is serving whiskey, sugar, bitters 
                    and, if you like, a cherry or orange garnish on the rocks. Properly made, it's strong but not too 
                    strong, sweet but not too sweet, and, most importantly, it's dead-simple and absolutely 
                    delicious.</p>

                    <p>The best bitters for an Old Fashioned are up for debate, but Angostura is classic for a reason, 
                    while Fee Brothers offer a welcome alternative.  
                    </p>
                    <p>The Old Fashioned is truly a drink worthy of the Gods</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 teaspoon (5g) superfine sugar, toasted sugar, or 1 sugar cube</li>
                    
                    <li>2 to 3 dashes bitters (Angostura bitters are traditional and work well; Fee Brothersâ€™ Whiskey Barrel-
                        Aged Old Fashioned Bitters are better)
                    
                    <li>2 ounces (60ml) bourbon or rye whiskey</li>
                    
                    <li>Orange and/or cocktail cherry, such as Luxardo to garnish (optional)</li>
                    
                    
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine whiskey, bitters, and sugar in a mixing glass. Add several large ice cubes 
                    and stir rapidly with a bar spoon to chill. Strain into a rocks glass with fresh ice.
